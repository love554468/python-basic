# Hexadecimal, octal, and binary numbers also fall under the Numeric data type
# umbrella.
# Hexadecimal numbers are base 16. They range from 0 to 9 and A to F. Octal numbers
# are base 8 numbers. They range from 0 to 7. Binary numbers are base 2 numbers and only
# include 0 and 1. Examples of each follow:
# Hexadecimal - 1B = 27 (decimal)
# Octal - 033 = 27 (decimal)
# Binary - 00011011 = 27 (decimal)

# octal 0o + number octal
# binary 0b + number binary
# int(0o33) = 27
#hex 0x + number hex
# datatype conversion
# int('1001',2)
# chr(65) - > 'A'
# ord(c) return the ascii value of character c 
# hex(x)
# oct(x)

# membership operator 
# we use membership operator to test to see if a particular value is a member of (or is included in) a particular object like alist or dictionary.class
# the identity operator check to see if the two object are the sam


# In retrun true if x is in y
# not in return true if x is not in y
# is return true if variable on each side refers to the same object
# is not return false if variable on each side refer to the same object

# bitwise operators ?
